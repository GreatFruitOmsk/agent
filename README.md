# WoTT IoT Agent

## Pre-requisites

* A Raspberry Pi 2 or newer with Raspbian
* [Docker CE installed](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/debian/)
  * It is advised that you also run `sudo usermod -aG docker pi` in order to run docker as the user pi without the need for `sudo`

## Building

To build the docker container, simply run:

```
$ mkdir -p ~/src
$ cd ~/src
$ git clone https://github.com/WoTTsecurity/agent.git
$ cd agent/agent
$ docker network create wott
$ ./run.sh
```

You can now find out the device's WoTT ID by running:

```
$ docker logs wott-agent | grep wott
Got WoTT ID: x.d.wott.local
```

### Note on the build process

* The build process is utilizing [multi-stage docker build](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/) to make sure we don't need to include all tools in the runtime environment.


## Installing without Docker

It is possible to run the WoTT agent without Docker. To do this on a Raspbian Stretch device, run the following command:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/WoTTsecurity/agent.git
$ cd agent
$ sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip python3-virtualenv
$ virtualenv -p python3 ~/.wott-venv
$ source ~/.wott-venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r agent/requirements.txt
```

You now have all the dependencies installed (with the exception of `ghostunnel`, which is used for end-to-end tunnels).

To start the agent, you just need to run:

```
$ sudo ~/.wott-venv/bin/python ~/src/agent/agent/agent.py
```



## Building Debian packages

```
$ cd agent
$ make deb
[...]
$ cd debian/dist
$ debsign -k10EC1B84E807A08B *.changes
[...]
