# WoTT IoT Agent

**WARNING:** WoTT is currently in beta. Use in production at your own risk.

IoT is becoming a global phenomenom. Virtually any device can now be connected to the internet from smart TVs to fridges with many developers looking to create their own IoT technology. However with more connectivity comes more security risks; with IoT devices providing more gateways for network attacks and fraudulent access (see [these](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-38364077) [news](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-48664251) articles).

For questions, please post them on our [forum thread](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=41&t=243538&sid=d378b110564b4773048c73fcb6679201) on the Raspberry Pi Forum.

## What is the WoTT Agent and what does it do?

**TL;DR:** Providing simplified security for IoT developers

WoTT aims to reduce that vulnerability by providing the security for you so that you can focus on your development. We want IoT developers to be able to develop their technology comfortable in the knowledge that their devices are secure from end-to-end.

To do this, WoTT provides a few things:

 * Simplified encryption of device communication
 * Cryptographic identity for your devices (verifying the identity of an accessing device)
 * Enabling the removal of hard coded credentials from your applications and firmware and allowing you greater control of credentials through WoTT

### WoTT provided certificates

In order to facilitate encrypted communication between two peers, we need a cryptographic certificate. WoTT provides this through the agent [1]. This serves both as a means for enabling encrypted communication, as well as giving each unique device a recognisable identity. It is this identity and its associated certificate that we use to secure and verify inter-device connection.

With the WoTT Agent certificate installed on a device, we can then establish connections to other devices and services by using the certificate to cryptographically prove the identity of said device [2].
**Note**, this is *not* the same as how your browser works. In this scenario, the client (i.e. your browser) verifies that the remote server (e.g. https://www.google.com) is actually being served from Googleâ€™s server and not an impersonator.
There is however no way for Google to cryptographically verify who you are- hence why you are required by Google to login with your details to access your email.

WoTT's Agent allows you to bypass the need for username/passwords by providing a certificate unique to your device that can be used to verify your identity. It is through these certificates that WoTT secures your devices and allows them to communicate with each other.

* [1] We do this by issuing an x509 certificate from our own Certificate Authority (CA).
* [2] This is done using something called Mutual TLS, or mTLS for short.

### WoTT credentials

This isn't to say that WoTT does away with credentials completely. Although it is best practice to use certificates as it crpytographically identifies your device, it is not doable in every instance. Passwords and APIs are still often required and typically hard-coded. We want to remove need for hard doded credentials,so WoTT provides the capacity for adding credentials you can manage yourself to bridge this gap.

You can add your own credentials such as API keys or usernames and passwords through the [WoTT dash](https://dash.wott.io) which we strongly reccomend that you use and familiarise yourself with. WoTT credentials are downloaded onto your device as JSON files containing the information you've added.

You can use this to introduce user authentication to your applications in scenarios where you want to enable access to non-WoTT devices in a secure way. This is especially relevant for WebApps where access is not device or OS restricted.

We have included below some examples that you can experiment with using both the WoTT certificates and credentials. Before you can access all this however, you will need to install the WoTT agent.

### Installing on Debian/Raspbian/Ubuntu

See the [Getting Started Guide](https://wott.io/documentation/getting-started).

#### Alternative runtime environments

 * [Python library](https://github.com/WoTTsecurity/agent/blob/master/docs/alternative_installation_methods.md#installation--python-runtime-advance://github.com/WoTTsecurity/agent/blob/master/docs/alternative_installation_methods.md#installation--python-runtime-advanced)


The certificates and credentials provided by the WoTT agent can now be used by you.

Consider some of these following examples to help you get started:

## Use Cases

**Note:** we have recently shipped our examples from this repository to our main [website](https://wott.io). Links have been updated to reflect this.

The examples utilise either credentials or certificates. It is useful to separate the examples into those that require user authentication (such as logins) and those where we just want to secure access through device authentication (using the WoTT certificate).

See the list below for examples of how to set up and use WoTT Agent enabled devices in the following scenarios

### Certificate managed examples

Many of the IoT cloud service examples use MQTT to publish/subscribe messages which is typically not encrypted and uses TCP transport protocols by default. WoTT uses mTLS which runs over the TCP layer. In essence, mTLS establishes a handshake and only allows connectivity if the handshake is successful (certificates are accepted). Here are some examples of how you can use WoTT's certificates to secure your IoT devices.

#### [Google Core IoT](https://wott.io/blog/tutorials/2019/06/14/google-core-iot)

Google Cloud Platform provides services that developers can use. Here we show you how to set up your WoTT Agent device and enroll it to your Google Cloud project to communicate with Google's services. Includes Google's MQTT example.

#### [Simple WebApp](https://wott.io/blog/tutorials/2019/06/16/simple-webapp)

A simple example use case of securing a Python 3 WebApp using two WoTT Agent devices acting as server and client. This guide includes an example WebApp, but the principle applies to any WebApp that you develop yourself- just ensure you do the correct setup.

#### [Configuring Nginx with Client Certificate Authentication (mTLS)](https://wott.io/blog/tutorials/2019/07/15/mtls-with-nginx)

One of our harder examples. Nginx is a web server with several other useful functions including reverse proxy. For this example, you will need two WoTT Agent devices: one as the server and one as the client. We recommend a Debian and Raspberry Pi. Here we use certificates as a means to verify browser access (note current browser only verify the server) to a server run by Nginx using their reverse proxy capabilitites.

#### [Securing Access to Mosquitto Broker](https://wott.io/blog/tutorials/2019/07/15/mosquitto-mqtt)

Although this example does not technically use certificates, it still relies on cryptographically identifying devices through their unique WoTT ID. Mosquitto is a popular broker for the MQTT protocol with several inbuilt functions that allow for security conifguration to protect the server from fradulent or malicious access. Here you will need two WoTT Agent devices, one acting as server and the other as client. We'll show you how to use WoTT's unqiue ID to secure access to a server without the need for a username and password.

#### [Connecting Edge IoT Devices to a Kubernetes Cluster](https://wott.io/blog/tutorials/2019/07/18/edge-to-kubernetes)

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) can be thought of as a manager for containerised applications (think of things like Docker). This example builds off our [Nginx]({{site.url}}/blog/tutorials/2019/07/15/mtls-with-nginx) example and requires prior knowledge of Kubernetes. Here we're looking at securing a connection from your IoT devices (of which you will likely have many as a developer) to your Kubernetes cluster through mTLS and WoTT. We recommend you do this either after looking at our Nginx example or if you already have a Kubernetes cluster you want to connect to.

#### [Securing Access to Mosquitto Broker from Paho Client](https://wott.io/blog/tutorials/2019/07/19/paho-mqtt)

We've covered previously how to secure a Mosquitto-Mosquitto client and server. Now we are using the very same trusty Mosquitto broker and connecting to it from a Paho client instead. Paho is part of the Eclipse foundation just like Mosquitto so it's a natural progression from our previous example. Once again, this example uses an MQTT topic to publish and subscribe to. You will need two WoTT Agent enabled devices.

### Credential managed examples

Unfortunately, there are still many cases where we cannot verify a device's access rights through certificates such as browser access which is not restricted to device or using another service with your IoT device which requires authentication. WoTT secures this by providing a credential service that you can manage yourself through WoTT's dash. Here are some examples:

#### [Simple WebApp with Basic HTTP Auth access](https://wott.io/blog/tutorials/2019/06/18/simple-webapp-auth)

Similar to the Simple App use case, here we are setting up another simple Python 3 WebApp. A WoTT Agent device acts as a server and here we show you how to use WoTT's dashboard to add credentials. These credentials can then be used to set up basic username:password authentication within the app to secure access from other devices/browsers using login authentication.

#### [Using WoTT credentials to manage Adafruit IO access through an MQTT Client](https://wott.io/blog/tutorials/2019/06/27/adafruit-io)

Adafruit IO is a service provided by Adafruit that concerns itself with simplifying the presentation and usage of data for IoT devices. To access Adafruit IO feeds within your own applications, you need your Adafruit IO username and access AIO key. This example shows how to store those credentials securely in WoTT and call the credentials to secure access to the feed within a Python 3 application.

#### [Managing access to Screenly OSE via HTTP authentication with WoTT authentication](https://wott.io/blog/tutorials/2019/06/25/screenly-ose)

Screenly OSE is a free digital signage platform. Access to Screenly OSE's management page can be secured with HTTP authentication via a login with a username and password. This example shows how to use WoTT dash to create and store these access credentials. These credentials can then be used within Screenly OSE.
