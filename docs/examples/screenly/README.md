# Using WoTT to secure access to Screenly

## Introduction

Screenly is a service that provides digital signage and acts as an OS on the host device. Essentially it treats your host device as a streaming service that projects visual media (such as images and webpages) onto a monitor from multiple different sources. Think of it as a manager for your visual media- you send the content via a browser on the Screenly management page, and the host device projects that content onto a monitor.

Screenly by default allows anyone within the network with the management page IP address to access it and send content. However, it does also provide HTTP authentication- and we can use WoTT's credentials to secure our Screenly device so that we can restrict and verify those who have access to it. 

Screenly offers a free OSE version that you can use. For this example you will need a Raspberry Pi, a monitor for Screenly to project onto; and at least one browser device. You will also need to have an account for the [WoTT Dashboard](https://dash.wott.io) in order to manage WoTT credentials.

## Installing WoTT agent on Screenly OSE

First you will need a Screenly device if you do not already.
Follow the instructions to install Screenly OSE (the free version) on your Raspberry Pi [here](https://www.screenly.io/ose/). We reccommend you follow the first option and use something like Etcher to flash the SD card with the Screenly boot. 
**Note** Screenly will overwrite your OS.

When the Raspberry Pi reboots, it will take you to the Screenly network configuration. You will need to access the SSID as you would a wifi network and enter the password shown.

Then navigate to the [Address](https://www.screenly.io/wifi) shown and login with your network details. This will grant you access to the Screenly management page. 

Now we need to secure access to your Screenly device. If you haven't installed the WoTT Agent already, install [it](https://github.com/WoTTsecurity/agent).

To do this on the Screenly device, you need to access the terminal through `CTRL` + `ALT` + `F1`. To return back to the GUI, it is `CTRL` + `ALT` + `F2`. 
Once here, follow the WoTT agent installation as you would on any other device. 

**Optional:** If you want to avoid using the terminal directly on your Screenly device in the future, enable SSH through the `sudo raspi-config` command. It is also reccommended that you change your User and Password from the default `pi` and `raspberry` (this will also improve your WoTT security score!) if you are going to do this.

You will now need to register the Pi on the WoTT dashboard. 


## Downloading WoTT credentials on Screenly OSE

Login to the WoTT Dash and navigate to 'Claim Device.' If you have installed the WoTT agent recently, the relevant information should be displayed on your terminal screen. If not, use the following commands:

``` 
$ sudo wott-agent whoami
$ sudo wott-aget claim-token
```

This will give you your Device ID and the token value to claim your device. 

Your Raspberry Pi should now be registered. Navigate to your Dashboard and select the Pi:

![pi](https://github.com/WoTTsecurity/agent/blob/master/docs/examples/screenly/rasbpi.png)

On the overview page, add a tag. This will be important for the credentials. This tag can be whatever you want, however we suggest something like `screenly-pi` or `pi` or a variant of that form:

![tag](https://github.com/WoTTsecurity/agent/blob/master/docs/examples/screenly/tag.png)

Now navigate to credentials and add a new credential with the following details:

```
Name = screenly
Key = login
Value = username:password
Owner = user
Tags = screenly-pi
```
Where the Owner is a valid Linux username, specifically the Linux user running Screenly (so by default on a Raspberry Pi, `pi`) and Key must be `login` (or the credentials won't be read). Value is the actual username and password of the login denoted by the single field `username:password`. You can change this value to match your own criteria, but it's fine for this example to leave it as is. 

You can change the Name value of `screenly` if you wish, but note that this is how WoTT will call the credential information, so if you do change this name, be aware to use the correct credential name later on. Make sure as well that the Tags match whatever Tag you assigned the Pi earlier.

You now need to set up the screenly configuration file to call the WoTT credentials. This file is in a hidden folder, so to access it do the following:

```
$ vi ~/.screenly/screenly.conf
```

This will open the config file in Vi. Add the following lines to the config:

```
[auth_wott]
wott_secret_name = screenly
```

and `ESC` + `:wq` to save.

Your credentials are now all set up. To download them onto the device, you will need to restart the WoTT Agent and the Screenly server:

```
$ service wott-agent restart
$ service screenly-web restart
```

There will now be a file on your Pi `screenly.json`. 

You may need to wait a few seconds for the server to restart. You can check the file exists by running the following command (if your user is `pi`): 

``` 
$ sudo find /opt/wott/credentials/pi
```

If the certificate is downloaded, you should receive a response like so:

```
/opt/wott/credentials/pi
/opt/wott/credentials/pi/screenly.json
```

## Securing Screenly OSE management page access with WoTT credentials

You will now need to navigate to the Screenly management page. This is the IP address displayed on the front of the Screenly device (or is the `inet` address when running the command `ifconfig` in the Screenly OSE terminal). 

Navigate to Settings:

![settings](https://github.com/WoTTsecurity/agent/blob/master/docs/examples/screenly/screenly-schedule.png)

Scroll down the page and underneath 'Authentication' select 'WoTT' and save your settings.

![Wott](https://github.com/WoTTsecurity/agent/blob/master/docs/examples/screenly/screenly-wott.png)

You have now enabled the WoTT credentials on Screenly OSE. Test this out by trying to access the management page from another browser (the image example below is opened in Chrome) and you will be required to login with the credentials you specified above (in this case, `username` and `password`)

![Chrome](https://github.com/WoTTsecurity/agent/blob/master/docs/examples/screenly/screenly-chrome.png)

If your credentials are correct, you will be successfully logged into the main Screenly management page and greeted by the Schedule Overview. 

## Closing Notes

You can change the WoTT credentials as you wish, but note that data is fetched by `wott-agent service` every 15 minutes, so for access to any immediate changes you implement you will need to restart the WoTT agent and server as before using

``` 
$ service wott-agent restart
$ service screenly-web restart
```
Additionally, you can use `pkill -f server.py` to kill the Screenly server, but this will take a few seconds to restart.

And that's it, you have successfully used WoTT credentials to set up authentication on Screenly OSE.
